Element weight calculator

'Element weight Calculator' is my first python program, which I think is quite useful for graduate students who is working on making single crystals.
It is quite easy to use this program to get the amount of elements we need instead of calculate them one by one.
First, we input the chemical formula of  our compound such as Ce-Cu2-Si2. (The first heavy fermion superconductor!)
Then we click the 'Go', which will give you the chemical formula in the entry of  'Elements and amount'
Input the element and weight, then click 'Calculate'.
We will have the result in the entry of  'result'.

The code attachment is on the bottom of this page. And  perhaps I will upload a modified exe version later.
Good luck for my crystal growth!
